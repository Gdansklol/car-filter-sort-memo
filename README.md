## React Seacrch Carname with filter, sort 
## + react hooks {useState, useEffect, useMemo}

- when the user types "Volvo" in the input field and presses the Enter key, the filtering and display of the Volvo car will.

- In this example, useMemo will memoize the result of filtering and sorting cars based on cars and searchTerm. It will only update when either cars or searchTerm changes, preventing unnecessary calculations on each render.

- If the problem persists, please describe the behavior you see when using the search field.

- With this update, the full information about the cars will be displayed only when the user has entered a car name in the input field. If the input field is empty, no information will be displayed. Try this and see if it solves the problem.
